            This paper examines the information content of the forward‐looking statements (FLS) in the Management Discussion and Analysis section (MD\&A) of 10‐K and 10‐Q filings using a Naïve Bayesian machine learning algorithm. I find that firms with better current performance, lower accruals, smaller size, lower market‐to‐book ratio, less return volatility, lower MD\&A Fog index, and longer history tend to have more positive FLSs. The average tone of the FLS is positively associated with future earnings even after controlling for other determinants of future performance. The results also show that, despite increased regulations aimed at strengthening MD\&A disclosures, there is no systematic change in the information content of MD\&As over time. In addition, the tone in MD\&As seems to mitigate the mispricing of accruals. When managers “warn” about the future performance implications of accruals (i.e., the MD\&A tone is positive (negative) when accruals are negative (positive)), accruals are not associated with future returns. The tone measures based on three commonly used dictionaries (Diction, General Inquirer, and the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) do not positively predict future performance. This result suggests that these dictionaries might not work well for analyzing corporate filings.},

            In this paper we develop a measure of competition based on management's disclosures in their 10‐K filing and find that firms’ rates of diminishing marginal returns on new and existing investment vary significantly with our measure. We show that these firm‐level disclosures are related to existing industry‐level measures of disclosure (e.g., Herfindahl index), but capture something distinctly new. In particular, we show that the measure has both across‐industry variation and within‐industry variation, and each is related to the firm's future rates of diminishing marginal returns. As such, our measure is a useful complement to existing measures of competition. We present a battery of specification tests designed to explore the boundaries of our measure and how it varies with the definition of industry and the presence of other measures of competition.},
