        "     Regression analysis is one of very useful predictive modeling techniques that identify the relationship between two or more variables. The objective of linear regression is to identify a linear line of best fit that can predict the outcome variable (target variable/dependent variable/response variable) for one or more independent variables(predictors). For example, we can draw a scatter diagram to see the relation between horsepower and miles per gallon (MPG). @fig-r-hrspower-mpg and @fig-py-hrspower-mpg show the relationship between horsepower and MPG in R and Python respectively. It is clear that there exists a negative relationship between horsepower and MPG and it makes sense because more power means higher fuel consumption. Similarly, there is negative relationship between vehicle weight and MPG because heavier vehicles need more energy to move (@fig-r-weight-mpg and @fig-py-weight-mpg). The equation of a simple linear regression is - $$y= mX + C$$\n",
        "\n",
        "     where $y$ = Target variable (Dependent variable); $m$ = slope or rate of change; $X$ = predictor or independent variable; and $C$ = intercept or constant.\n",

The regression equation we find is `y = 40-0.16x`, where $y$ is MPG, $x$ is Horsepower, $40$ is intercept, and $1.6$ is slope, which means one unit change of Horsepower results in 1.6 units reduction of MPG and the value of MPG is 40 when horsepower is 0. @fig-py-reg-equation shows the same results.\n",

The coefficient of determination is represented by $R^2$. The value of $R^2$ ranges between $0$ and $1$, where $0$ indicates poor fit and $1$ indicates perfect fit. There is a problem with $R^2$; it increases as the number of independent variable increases. Therefore, when we compare models with different numbers of independent variables, adjuted $R^2$ is used to evaluate the model because it penalizes models with a large number of predictors.\n",

A low p-value (\\<0.05) indicates that we can reject the null hypothesis, meaning that a predictor with a low p-value should be included in the model because it has statistically significant effect on the target variable.\n",

        "     Indpendence means that each observation (data point) is independent of the others, meaning that the error terms in the model are not correlated with each other and the occurrence of one observation does not influence the probability of another observation occurring; essentially, each data point should be considered a separate, unrelated event from the others. We can check this assumption by Durbin-Watson test. The null hypothesis (H~0~) is there is no correlation among the residuals. Basically, the test detects autocorrelation in the residuals of a linear regression model. The test statistic is a value between 0 and 4, with the following interpretations: 2: No autocorrelation; \\< 2: Positive autocorrelation; \\> 2: Negative autocorrelation. To solve the independence issue, it is suggested that for positive serial correlation, consider adding lags of the dependent and/or independent variable to the model. For negative serial correlation, check to make sure that none of your variables are overdifferenced, and For seasonal correlation, consider adding seasonal dummy variables to the model. However, as a rule of thumb, test statistic values between the range of 1.5 and 2.5 are considered normal. One limitation of the DW test is that it can only test for first-order serial correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Alternatively, we can can visually examine a scatterplot of the residuals (errors) against the fitted values (@fig-r-assump1 and @fig-py-assump1); if there is no clear pattern, it suggests that the independence assumption is likely satisfied. Independence assmption is important because violating it can lead to unreliable hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.\n",

Theoretically, we want to see @fig-assump3. @fig-r-assump3 and @fig-py-assump3 show Scale-Location plot (also called spread-location plot) of our model. From @fig-r-assump3 and @fig-py-assump3, it is clear that residual plots have a trend (are not all equally spread out). Thus, the assumption is violated. One solution to the problem is that using log or square root transformation of outcome variable. Moreover, we can use Non-Constant Error Variance (NVC) test to test the assumption. If p-value of the test is less than 0.05, then null hypothesis is rejected, meaning that homoscedasticity is violated. Moreover, Breusch-Pagan test or White test can also be used to test homoscedasticity.\n",
